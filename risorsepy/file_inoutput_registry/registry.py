# Prof. Jekyll conducts classes with students and regularly makes notes in a text file.
# Each line of the file contains three elements: the student's first name, the student's last name,
# and the number of points the student received during certain classes.

# The elements are separated with white spaces. Each student may appear more than once inside
# Prof. Jekyll's file.

# Your task is to write a program which:

# asks the user for Prof. Jekyll's file name;
# reads the file contents and counts the sum of the received points for each student;
# prints a simple (but sorted) report, just like this one:
# Andrew   Cox      1.5
# Anna     Boleyn   15.5
# John     Smith    7.0
# Output

# Note:

# your program must be fully protected against all possible failures:
#   the file's non-existence,
#   the file's emptiness,
#   or any input data failures;
# encountering any data error should cause
# immediate program termination, and the error should be presented to the user;
# implement and use your own exceptions hierarchy â€“ we've presented it in the editor;
# the second exception should be raised when a wrong line is detected,
# and the third when the source file exists but is empty.
# Tip: Use a dictionary to store the students' data.
